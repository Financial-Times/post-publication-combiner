## Introduction

This service builds combined messages (content + internal content + annotations) based on events received from `PostConceptAnnotations` or `PostPublicationEvents`.
This is a combination point for synchronizing the content, internal content and metadata publish flows.

Note: One publish event can result in two messages in the `CombinedPostPublicationEvents` topic (one for the content publish and one for the metadata publish).

- For `PostPublicationEvents` messages the service extracts the published content from the messages and requests the internal content and metadata from `internal-content-api`. It is possible for `internal-content-api` to return empty annotations field.
- For `PostConceptAnnotations` messages the service extracts only the content uuid from the message and requests the content from `document-store-api` and internal content and metadata from `internal-content-api`. It is possible for `document-store-api` to return `404 Not Found` fot the provided content uuid.

The service then constructs a `CombinedPostPublicationEvents` message with the received data. It is possible for either `content` or `metadata` fields in the constructed message to be empty, but not both.

### CombinedPostPublicationEvents format

```json
{
  "uuid": "some_uuid", // content uuid
  "contentUri": "",
  "lastModified": "",
  "deleted": false,
  "content": {}, // data returned from document-store-api
  "internalContent": {}, // data returned from internal-content-api without annotations
  "metadata": [] // annotations data returned from internal-content-api
}
```

### Dependencies

- [document-store-api](https://github.com/Financial-Times/document-store-api) (`/content` endpoint)
- [internal-content-api](https://github.com/Financial-Times/internal-content-api) (`/internalcontent/{uuid}?unrollContent=true` endpoint)
- [content-collection-rw-neo4j](https://github.com/Financial-Times/content-collection-rw-neo4j) (`/content-collection/content-package/{uuid}` endpoint)

## Installation

In order to build, execute the following steps:

```shell
    go get github.com/Financial-Times/post-publication-combiner
    cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/Financial-Times/post-publication-combiner
    go build .
```

## Running locally

1. Run the tests and install the binary:

```shell
    go test ./...
    go install
```

2. Run the binary (using the `help` flag to see the available optional arguments):

```shell
  $GOPATH/bin/post-publication-combiner
```

Please check `--help` for more details.

Test:
    You can verify the service's behaviour by checking the consumed and the generated Kafka messages.
    You can also use the force endpoint.

## Build and deployment

- Built by Docker Hub (from master or from github tags): [coco/post-publication-combiner](https://hub.docker.com/r/coco/post-publication-combiner/)
- CI provided by CircleCI: [post-publication-combiner](https://circleci.com/gh/Financial-Times/post-publication-combiner)

## Service/Utility endpoints

### Force endpoint

`POST` - `/{content_uuid}` - Creates and forwards a CombinedPostPublicationEvent to the queue for the provided UUID.

Refer to [api.yml](_ft/api.yml) for api related documentation.

## Healthchecks

Our standard admin endpoints are:
`/__gtg` - returns 503 if any if the checks executed at the /__health endpoint returns false

`/__health`

Checks if:

- kafka is reachable
- document-store-api is reachable
- internal-content-api is reachable

`/__build-info`

### Logging

- The application uses the FT [go-logger](https://github.com/Financial-Times/go-logger/tree/v2) library, based on [logrus](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus).
- NOTE: There is no logging for `/__build-info` and `/__gtg` endpoints as they are called frequently.
